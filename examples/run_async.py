"""
This example will execute 10 queries in total, 2 concurrent queries at a time.
Each query will sleep for 2 seconds before returning.
Here's a sample output that shows that the queries are executed concurrently in batches of 2:
```
Completed query 1, elapsed ms since start: 2002
Completed query 0, elapsed ms since start: 2002
Completed query 3, elapsed ms since start: 4004
Completed query 2, elapsed ms since start: 4005
Completed query 4, elapsed ms since start: 6006
Completed query 5, elapsed ms since start: 6007
Completed query 6, elapsed ms since start: 8009
Completed query 7, elapsed ms since start: 8009
Completed query 9, elapsed ms since start: 10011
Completed query 8, elapsed ms since start: 10011
```
